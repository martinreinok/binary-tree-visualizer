# binary-tree-visualizer
A very simple binary search tree visualizer using turtle.   
For quick debugging as online tools did not support this type of tree format.  
Partly courtesy of OpenAI :)

# Example input -> output
Input:
```pyton
tree = [{"16","a"},[{"5","a"},[{"4","a"},null,null],[{"15","a"},[{"10","a"},null,null],null]],[{"30","a"},null,[{"40","a"},null,[{"50","a"},[{"45","a"},null,[{"47","a"},null,null]],[{"60","a"},null,null]]]]]
```
